This just collects some SDL tutorials I've followed, in C++. The different
lessons are in the git log history.

- John Hammond's [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DiggmjJ_C_C4][youtube]] lessons.

- Will Usher has some nice [[http://www.willusher.io/sdl2%2520tutorials/2013/08/17/lesson-1-hello-world][tutorials]].

- LazyFoo. He's now updated them to [[http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php][SDL2]]. (I haven't uploaded my files).

- [[http://headerphile.com/][Headerphile]], on SDL2 and C++11.
